# NOTE:-

I am in the middle of updating these examples for version 0.8.0.  Currently, I have only gotten to the first 2 chapters. You will notice that all of the projects are present, but everything above Chapter 2 is empty.  The rest of the chapters will be filled in over the course of the Fall '13 semester.  Sorry for any inconvenience!

For older versions, please take a look at tagged commits.

# Introduction:-

These examples were created for the class [Code for Art](http://codeforart.cc/) at the [Parsons Design & Technology MFA program](http://www.newschool.edu/parsons/mfa-design-technology/).  They are meant to serve as an introduction to [openFrameworks](http://www.openframeworks.cc/), a creative coding toolkit.  They are designed for beginners, and meant to be explored sequentially.
